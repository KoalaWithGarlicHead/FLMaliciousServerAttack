The cut went away and the swelling of the bump went down but there is still a small bump and it hurts a bit when I touch it and if I look up I can feel pressure from that area to my left eye. Should I be worried?",

If in doubt local ultrasound of the swelling will be confirmation of diagnosis. Tab chymoral forte twice a day before meals will help in early reduction of swelling."

    "doctor": "Hi!welcome to HCM!Iron pills take about 5-7 days to start their effect and hemoglobin levels rise within 2-3 weeks of starting iron supplementation. Therapeutic doses of iron (50-60 mg of oral elemental iron twice daily) should increase hemoglobin levels by 0.7-1.0 g/dL per week.You may need to continue to take an iron supplement for several months in order to build up iron stored in your body and prevent anemia from returning.Hope this will help you!Take care!"

Please advice me...",
    "doctor": "Hi, You have ot mentioned about the type of treatment undertaken which corrected your problem.If it was a surgical extraction in the 2nd or third molar area, it may have caused some compression/damage to the inferior alveolar nerve because of which you are feeling this numbness in your underlips region. The nerve usually heals on its own. You can take supplements to enhance the regeneration though which can be prescribed by a Dentist."

    "patient": "Q1: what will happen if I dont take my prescribed dose of seroquel xr, and I ve been told by my doctor to take my dose (50mg+50mg+400mg) about 6 or seven o clock each day, if I miss the dose and don t take it till tomorrow evening, how will it affect me?? and what will it do to my brain\\body. note: I have not taken my dose since half eleven last night.",
    "doctor": "Hi,    I understand your concern.    IT is good to take the prescribed  dose of Seroquil regularly. A regular follow up is advised to readjust the dose.     A sudden break in taking routine dose for several days is likely to cause withdrawal symptoms with sometimes relapse.     But missing a single dose does not cause much difference to body/brain.     When a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as remembered. But if it  is  nearer to next scheduled dose, it should  be dropped.     Thanks."

Also some heart disease and some drugs can elevate GGT.

If the pain is only after ejaculation then the possibility is a spasm of the pelvic floor and genital muscles.

    "doctor": "A lump in the breast requires triple evaluation in the form of examination, mammograms and needle aspiration. A burning lump could be an abscess or fibroadenosis  or malignancy. As it was present earlier and has now developed symptoms, it has more risk of malignancy. This increases if your age is more than 45. It requires an examination by a doctor with further investigation if suspicious."

Low levels of albumin ( protein made in the liver), low levels of throid hormone, blockade of lymph supply from the legs ( can be due to infections like filariasis, obesity), leaky valves in leg veins, and leg clots are other common causes of leg swelling.

Those are normal melanin pigments deposited in the conjunctiva. They are not a tumor. You should be concerned only if you notice a sudden change in growth or color.

The medicines takes 1-2 days to bring down the infection. do saline gargling. Once the infection comes down, then you can get the tooth treated with RCT or extraction.I hope my answer will help you, take care."

This bruising has been getting darker over the last 5 days. Should I be concerned about this?",

It would be a little surprising if that were the only part of your body to experience signs of dryness! Another possibility is fungal infection, i.e. \"jock itch\". Often there is some redness as well. You might consider trying a two-week course of an over-the-counter antifungal cream, such as clotrimazole, miconazole, or terbinafine."

    "patient": "Hi I had severe abdominal pain (15) for about two hours...late at 12 am...I finally was able to take two aleve which helped me relax a little wqith some pain and after going to the bathroom.. My pain was as if I took a strong laxative. I still feel week and tired",
    "doctor": "HI. Such pains come when there is food poisoning or intestinal infection as the body wants to expel something which it feels is dangerous to it. Weakness and tiredness is due to loss of potassium and other electrolytes into the intestines. You may need an antibiotic and supportive medicines as per further progress, you should visit ER  to avoid further complications and to take proper treatment"

    "patient": "I am 2-3 days past ovulation , trying to conceive...woke up on day 2 past ovulation with extreme stomach cramps , then was moody all day. toda is 3 days past ovulation, and i have had a horrible headache all day.... and woke up this morning with severe leg/ calf pain. i had charley horses with my last baby when i was pregnant , but this was just leg pain as if i had done extreme exercising but i hadnt done a thing...was wondering if there is any way i could be pregnant?",
    "doctor": "Hi, The stomach cramps may or may not be related to ovulation; there may be associated intestinal or urinary infection too and this has to be ruled out. The cause of the leg pain could be anything from an electrolyte imbalance to arrested circulation, which again needs assessment. So, it would be wise to see a physician and get advice informing the doctor that you are trying to conceive. Take care."

    "patient": "my grand daughter has a staff infection on her butt from a stay at the hospital...she was over for a visit and helped prepare a meal..we didn t know it was contagious until we looked it up on google..she put the biscuits on the pan for me when preparing the meal.. my question is ;;are we at risk contacting the staff infection?the biscuits were baked,,,also we exchanged good by hugs...",
    "doctor": "HI...staphylococcal infection can spread and in hospitals usually if it is suspected, contact isolation is advised. The risk of staphylococcal infection is definitely there. But as she has got it now, the best way would be to go about with a oral antibiotic course of Clindamycin.Topical ointment like Mupirocin will also help.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"

    "patient": "my 6 year old complained of a bugbite on his head last week.  i noticed today that he has a visible lump on his head.  It doesnt appear to be a bite and it seems bigger than it was last week. he doesnt remember hitting it and he says it doesnt hurt.  should i be overly concerned?",
    "doctor": "Hi.Yes , you should be concerned as the cause and effect is not known.I would advise you to consult a Doctor as he sees more of such atypical problems. IT may be a problem in a child of just 6 years. We have to confirm this is not infected and may need a treatment accordingly.Having a hematoma is definitely a possibility. But ruling out other problems is very important."

    "patient": "my brother is 34 years old and he is suffering from bilateral chronic kidney disease and minimal ascites . He has been on dialysis for the past 3 days . Before the urea and creatinine was 274 and 15 after the second dialysis the urea and creatinine is 147 and 10. During the process he keeps getting high fever as high as 104 degree C and his hemoglobin is the same 6.1 which is very less. what should i do?",
    "doctor": "HiThanks for the query1) Low haemoglobin is common in patients on dialysis. This needs treatment in the form of erythropoietin and iron injections under the supervision of your nephrologist. He may also transfuse blood if required2) The cause of fever can only be determined by careful examination of the patient and review of all blood and imaging tests.Hope this helpsGood luck."
