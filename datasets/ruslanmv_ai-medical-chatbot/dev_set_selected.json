Few weeks back playing football I had a collision that gave me a bruise, and now the bruisings gone down, pains gone away, I'm left with a lump and when pressed on its bloody painful, I've read into it tonight on the internet, and there's no real answer to what it could be, anywhere to small fracture to cancer but thanks for replying.",
    "doctor":"Hi.The pain on pressure on an old lump can be due to::: Due to the process of healing called organization, the nerves can become pressed on or entrapped in a scar. Hematoma getting tender can be due to tightness (tense).If there is a fracture the pain will be persistent and cancers are totally a different problem , it is not a cancer"

    "doctor":"Hello. Pregnancy usually occurs when sexual activity is practiced without protection, during the fertile period. You can estimate your fertile period using the calendar method. If your menstrual cycle is regular, then ovulation occurs 14 days before the next anticipated period. So, around that ovulation period, one week on either side is fertile period. As you had sex just after your period, it is unlikely to cause pregnancy. For more information consult a sexologist online -->"

I went to bed and when I got up I couldn't lift my leg to get back into bed and I could barely walk. What is going on?",
    "doctor":"Your description of symptoms suggest an pain over a short period. This can typically happen if there was a pulled muscle\/ligaments during running, the risk being greater if there was no warm-up and stretching done before jogging. Also if you started jogging after a gap of few weeks, that may result in acute muscle strain. You need to take rest and avoid further jogging and take pain medicines like Diclofenac and paracetamol combination twice daily for 2-3 days."

One is yellowish brown in color and another one is pink in color. It might have a hair coming out of the side, but I am not sure. I am attaching the photo. Could either of them be molluscum? Please explain me.",
    "doctor":"Hi. One of the lesions looks like milia, obstruction of sweat duct, which is very close differential of molluscum contagiosum (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Another lesion just looks like pseudofolliculitis. Both of them have very less chance of spreading. Do not worry about them. You can get the milia removed at any day.

This causes stretch and may lead to lower back pain. If the prolapse is mild n back pain Is less then u may take medicines for ur symptoms but if it's more and causing disturbance to ur daily work and urinary retention then I advice u to consult a doctor n take his advice regarding surgery.

If you are Rh-negative and your husband Rh-positive, then the problem of Rh incompatibility arises in the baby, that too in the second child.

If you have a burning sensation or feeling urgency to void the bladder, it indicates an infection. So, get your urine test done along with fasting blood sugar.

Owing to your age, as you are in the perimenopausal group, chances of getting natural pregnancy are lesser as ovulation tends to dwindle at this stage.

The wax that is used for face is different, so always check whether your salon proffessional is using correct wax. However if the hair growth is thick, go with laser hair reduction. Shaving is not advised as friction due to shaving and also sometimes due to threading may leave pigmentation.Hope this helped."

    "doctor":"Hi, I think you have two options.  First you can go for a tubal recanalization operation. The success rate depends on many factors like length of tubes, type of tubectomy done and age. Generally if tube length is 4mm or more, success rate is 50 to 60 percent. The other option is to undergo IVF. You can discuss with your doctor regarding both options and then can decide."

You have to take combination of long acting beta agonist and long acting inhaled steroids like seroflo or seretide. Seretide is little better because of drug delivery technique.

    "patient":"After having a pelvic sonogram the results showed I have fibroids in my cervical canal and on top of uterus. Trying to conceive for 3yrs no luck. If this fibroids get removed what are the chances of conceiving and could they really block sperm getting to Fallopian tubes?",
    "doctor":"Hello, I would be happy to help you with your questions. Given the location of the fibroids (down near the cervix) there is no doubt that that this can affect the ability for sperm to get into the uterus and up to the fallopian tubes.  The ability to remove them depends entirely on their size and location.  One has to be careful about attempts to remove them if this might threaten your uterus.  Consultation with a fertility expert might be the best course. I hope that this helps and good luck!"

In the meantime, clean the area that you think was pricked and be very careful in the future.

If there is bruise present on the gums, then it can be possible that the roots of teeth which are present below the gums are also hurt.Better that once you should visit a child dentist ( pedodontist) and get an x - ray done for confirmation.

I know that it is not advised to have a baby while either partner is taking this drug so my question is, what options do we have if we want to have a baby in the future? From what I understand methotrexate is a long term drug i.e. he will take it forever.",
    "doctor":"Hi.If his condition is better controlled, then you can discuss with his doctor options of conception and taking him off the drug. There will be a wait period during which the doctor will continuously monitor him and also check to see if he will be fit for natural conception.After this, you can go ahead with natural conception. Or else, a donor sperm or adoption are last resorts.Best wishes."

There might be some deep bites extending to muscles, which can cause sharp pain for few days. You can take Diclofenac\/Seratiopeptidase combination for pain relief as it shows good response because of its anti inflammatory actions also. Apply ice packs and immobilize the hand for few days. If the pain persists for long, better to consult a physician and get evaluated. Wishing you good health. Thanks."

Some persons may have a silent drip where only a cough is present.This is treated with a nasal spray.I hope this helps"

When I lift up my shirt, the left side is clearly bigger than the right side is. And it feels sore when i push on it in a certain spot. also when i sit it just feels uncomfortable sometimes. when i rub it, it feels a little numb. What could it be? I dont have health insurance so I'm trying to avoid that if I can.",
    "doctor":"Hello!Thank you for the query.It is very important to determine if this lump comes from the breast or is a separate thing. In case of breast lump it can be even a cancer that is why it should not be ignored.If you are sure this is separate thing, most likely it is a lipoma or other benign lesion.The best way to find out what it is, is to have soft tissues ultrasound of this area.Hope this will help.Regards."

    "patient":"Hello doctor, I have crooked teeth, four up and four down. I want to know what should be done to them to fix. I had recently started facing the problem of gum bleeding and bad smell from mouth. Some yellow decay are there inside my lower four teeth.",
    "doctor":"Hi. I can understand the problem. It is called lower jaw insufficiency and it is an orthodontic problem with crowding in lower front teeth. The yellow layer is called dental calculus and it is a calcified dirt. I would suggest you undergo orthodontic treatment. The dentist may extract one or two teeth as a part of treatment after a thorough examination. He shall align the teeth properly in a year duration. Also, undergo scaling and polishing of your teeth at the earliest."

    "patient":"I have multiple stones in my right kidney, and have passed many, and lately had kub ultrasound, found out that there are still about 14 to 15 stones left... with hydronephrosis. The radiologist says my kidney looks bad already and said i should have it removed. I went to the nephrologist to show my result and he asked to have a ct stonogram, which i haven t done yet. If i pass all the stones, will my kidney still be ok?",
    "doctor":"Dear Patient,the answer is: it depends. In fact, if in your life you had lot of episodes of hydronephrosis, kidneys may be suffering this past. Otherwise, kidney stones can be eliminated without reliquaries for kidney function. For sure, you should study the type of stone you produce, perform PTH, vitamin D, calcium, phosphorus, urinalysis and suprasaturation of urines. This may give us an hint on the underlying cause, and hopefully stop the process.Let me know,"
