    "output": "Hi, Thanks fir writing in. A raspy voice is due to stimulation of the recurrent laryngeal nerve which supplies the vocal cords. It is possible that your friend has a lowered immune status after taking treatment for multiple myeloma. This might cause him to have infection in the throat which is causing irritation to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Any infection or condition in the throat might cause the raspy voice. It is suggested that he consults the ENT specialist immediately and has a clinical examination of his throat done. This will show any inflammatory changes in the region and whether it requires treatment. Please tell him to do throat gargle with warm water twice daily to soothe the throat. The raspy voice is not related to his spine but might have an indirect association to his treatment which he is getting right now. Please do not worry."

This is a high dose and should be avoided unless there is an obvious benefit arising by doing such an investigation.

I put Bacitracin ointment on them. They seem to be disappearing. I have had sexual contact this past Sunday, the 19th. They developed on Mon., the 20th. I would hope that this is not the beginning of Shingles. What could these possibly be??",
    "output": "Hi, I have read about your concern. Thanks for asking. Let me tell you one thing about shingles. They are not sexually transmitted. Shingles are caused by a virus called Herpes zoster, the same virus which causes chickenpox which might be well known to you. Shingles only occurs in people who have had previous episode of chickenpox probably in childhood.  In people who have chickenpox in childhood, the virus enters nerve cells in body called dorsal root ganglia. There it stays dormant. When the persons immune system is weakened, it gets reactivated and develops into shingles.  Also, it is restricted to only certain areas where that particular nerve supplies the skin called dermatomes. It doesn't occur in the way you have mentioned like red marks. Shingle has many blisters or vesicles. So don't at all worry about shingles. You might have developed some allergy to some clothes or due to excessive sweating. Just try to avoid clothes that irritate you. Try to keep the area with red rashes Chat Doctor.  It will mostly resolve by itself. As bacitracin ointment has worked on them, you can continue applying it. If it doesn't resolve in few days, visit your dermatologist."

    "output": "Hi Vila, Thanks for trusting Chat Doctor with your query. Your problem seems to be a very rare kind of addiction.  Based on the information provided, it seems you are motivated to give up this addiction as you appear to understand the fact that it is hurting your body physically. It seems that you are struggling psychologically as well. I guess first and foremost, you should get yourself checked physically as raw rice can cause some physical issues and some problems of menstruation could be due to other unrelated/related issues. An opinion from physician or gynecologist might be helpful. Next comes the issue of addiction. I suppose one method could be to use Exposure and response prevention strategy. The basic principle would be to expose you to raw rice which will possibly induce the desire to eat it and then have someone stop you from eating it. During this process, you might experience significant restlessness and anxiety. If you are motivated enough and know relaxation techniques, try to be in this situation for approximately 90 minutes or when you feel your anxiety is wearing off without any additional help. You will realize that gradually the intensity of your craving is reducing and after sometimes start doing it yourself. You can take the help of a clinical psychologist in this process. The role of medication would be very limited. However, I believe consulting a psychiatrist to explore other psychological issues (if any) can be of further benefit. Hope this will be of some help.

I was on remicade for my disease until 10 weeks ago when I started having complications with it which I was on it for over 3 years so its to to be expected. However for the last two weeks my head has been feeling really dizzy. I also keep getting headaches. The headaches are not constant but the dizziness is and sometimes it feels like there is pressure on the top of my head. I just started taking entyvio for the crohns but my first dose was last Thursday, so I know that s not the problem. My question is though could the remicaid along with the steroids that they were giving me at the time be causing the dizziness and the headaches especially since we had to just stop it or could there be something worse going on? I m supposed to do an MRI but were waiting on the insurance company to give the ok. It s just this dizziness keeps getting worse and I was just wondering if anyone has any ideas on what might be causing it? Thank you Sincerely Darlene Emmett",
    "output": "Hi, Headache and dizziness may not be due to Remade or a steroid, but it can be due to a migraine. The condition can be managed with Ergot amine or Carbamazepine before you go for an MRI. If headaches and dizziness are still there then an MRI can be considered. Till then, it can be managed as a migraine headache. It is a kind of functional disorders and not the pathology of any kind. Certain precipitating factors are there which can be responsible for a headache, like psychological disturbances, stress, anxiety and sometimes diet too (spicy, fried, high-calorie diet).

    "output": "Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor ! I understand your concern and would explain that high platelet number could be related to chronic inflammation. The sepsis could lead to high platelet count. From the other hand as he has fever, it is not the proper time to change his anti-epilepsy Chat Doctor.  I don't think that Kendra is related to high platelet number or sepsis. An infection could be the cause of his clinical situation. Coming to this point, I would recommend first treat the infection and the fever. After the fever is gone, you may discuss on the possible changes to his therapy. In this regard, Aborigine or Valproate would be a good treatment option. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Kind regards, "

    "output": "Hello! Thank you for the query. First you need to know that as you are on antibiotics right now, any inflammatory disease in the abdomen can give fewer symptoms than usually. Moreover, WBC can be in normal range if the antibiotics are used. Lower right abdominal can be caused by appendicitis, urinary tract infection, ovarian cyst, pregnancy. Appendicitis should be ruled out at first. As the pain is still present, you should visit your doctor again, have blood tests repeated (WBC and CRP) and abdominal ultrasound. Sometimes it is more safe to perform appendectomy than wait and persist unsure. If you are a female, transvaginal ultrasound should be also performed as well as pregnancy test. Hope this will help.

    "output": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. There are many phases of erection and some of it is also controlled by emotions and foreplay. Sometimes in the night, intake of alcohol or certain addictive substances may inhibit erection. I suggest you avoid alcohol and any intake of any addictive substance if you are using. If you do not take alcohol or addictive substances then lack of erection may be due to stress and low energy levels. You must spend more time with your partner at night having foreplay and use lubrication jelly. Also try and keep your energy level high just before having sex by taking a nutritious dinner and taking some rest."

At present, she is on anti seizure medicine and continue giving the medicines, her other complaints will improve once her blood Hemoglobin levels and electrolyte levels will come in normal range. Do proper care of her, give plenty of citrus fruits and juices. Reassure her, and she will be all right in no time. Thanks the Jestingly RATE"

    "input": "Hi, I ve been working with Xylene for 6 years. During this time (within first year) I developed Fibromyelgia, Chronic Fatigue, Anxiety, a feeling that I ve lost some sensation and co-ordination in my hands and patches of skin that occasionally become supersensitive. I used to feel intoxicated while working in the lab but by the time I got home was super aggressive and angry. I no longer feel intoxicated when working with it. After 4 years I noticed when working with Xylene my face began to burn/itch. In the last two weeks I have developed irritation in the Trachea immediately after commencing a major project with Xylene. It settles down when I go home but immediately on entering the lab the trachea gets irritated and I cough. How do I know if it is the Xylene causing me problems?",
    "output": "Xylene is a pretty toxic organic solvent. It certainly affects the liver, and liver function tests are necessary. Likely also to affect nerves. A nerve conduction test can show if the nerves are sick BUT, there isn't good treatment for it except stop exposure and hope. It would take months for the nerves to correct themselves. Then lung exposure to xylene can cause lung fibrosis. This is testable with lung function tests (x-ray, spirometry, but mainly diffusion testing)."

    "output": "Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor. I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint it seems that due to hitting with a metal bar there has been soft tissue injury and due to injury there has been inflammation and swelling due to accumulation of inflammatory exudate and cells at the injury site. There also seems to be ruptured blood vessels leading to bruising and formation of a Hematoma. The movable gel like lump seems to be a Hematoma and is due to accumulation of blood from ruptured blood vessels. I would suggest you that you need not worry about it as it will resolve gradually. You can do alternate warm and cool compresses over the lump. You can also give him anti-inflammatory painkillers like Ibuprofen. In case if there is pain numbing gel containing Lidocaine can also be advised. You can also apply Heparin gel over the area as it will help in faster disruption of the hematoma as well as bruising.

I am a letter carrier (mail man) been on the job since 2005. Very labour intensive. The satchel is designed to distribute all the weight I carry on my back rather than on my shoulders. In 2003 i had an xray showed my lower back was normal. Are these present problems job related?",
    "output": "Hello, Due to your job profile, there will be an additional weakness of the muscles of the spinal column leading to compression over the disc which is in between the two vertebral bodies.  To avoid more compression the body had taken the new position of the spinal column leading to scoliosis. At most times the disc which is situated in between the vertebral bodies loses the water content in that leading to reduced intervertebral disc place. I can say this is functional scoliosis and needs a correction to avoid more trouble to the intervertebral disc. The first thing to do is meeting up an orthopedist to get it physically examined, and also an MRI will be advised. Later taking medication for pain will be recommended.  Also, physical therapy will be helpful to correct functional scoliosis and also improving muscle strength with some exercise of correcting the spinal column. Hope I have answered your query.

After 2 MRI and every test imginable I got no anwers.  Now I live on pain meds.

Is there anythng I can do besides this?",
    "output": "Hello, Thanks for your query. The low backache is a result of muscle spasm which in itself is a protective mechanism body develops so that the back avoids abnormal posture. For pain to go, it takes not only rest (on a comfortable bed) but also avoidance of particular positions (during work, rest or recreation). Avoid sleeping on sides and stomach in case you do. While on work don't sit in one position for more than an hour and take frequent stretch breaks. Do not bend forward to lift things up, bend the knees and hips for that. Also discontinue any strenuous activity or exercises for some time. You might need to consult your orthopaedician for a detailed physical examination and appropriate investigations. It might help with few medications and physiotherapy for a few days. Physiotherapy particularly lumbar traction for a week and back strengthening exercises after pain relief work well. Remember that medicines usually don't play a role in long term treatment, what does are exercises. Few exercises that the therapist will teach you must be done for lifetime. I do hope that you have found something helpful, and I will be glad to answer any further query. Take care"

Cardiologist started digoxin 0.125 mg od, frusemide 20 mg od and pentids 800 mg od. My wife is having mild breathlessness and palpitations on exertion. My cardiologist opines that pregnancy is high risk and nothing to do at present and advices valve replacement in future when symptoms develop. Please give your opinion.",
    "output": "Hi, This is Chat Doctor.  Moderate MR with mild MS does not require surgery at present, but it may progress in future & may require surgery. She will have mild breathing difficulty which is a normal disease natural history. Necessary medicine she is already taking. Pent ids is an oral penicillin which will prevent further damage to valve & has to be taken life long. Palpitations are also very common & these type of patients may developed irregular heart rate called AF which she is also prone to developed as she has a P Mitral in ECG which means enlargement of a chamber of heart (Left Atrium). Pregnancy is not contraindicated & can be proceeded with close monitoring of a cardiologist. But if the pulmonary pressure is higher than the pregnancy will be high risk. We also give beta blocker to such patients. So remember to ask this with your cardiologist on your next visit. Rest don't worry, be in regular follow up with your cardiologist, do echo every 6 months & keep taking the medicines, and she will be fine. Thanks"

    "output": "Hello, Thanks for posting your query, Several reasons exist for our teeth turning yellow. Some people are born with slightly yellow teeth naturally, and only unnatural dentistry, such as veneers, can fix them. It is perfectly normal for people to have slightly yellowish teeth. The problem is that the teeth become more yellow with time. The number one reason for the yellowing of teeth is staining from foods, Chat Doctor.  Teeth are made of four layers of tissues. The innermost layer is the cementum. It attaches the root of the tooth to the jaw bone. Next, is the pulp. The pulp contains the blood vessels and nerve-endings in the tooth. I suggest you go to your dentist so that he/she can examine, determine and recommend what's the best teeth whitening product to be used hope this information has been both informative and helpful Regards"

Even though the disease is there for more than 5 years ?Even though the person has undergone an Nasal operation (a curved bone in the nose has been removed).What are all the precautionary steps that can be taken to overcome from this ? Is there any specific vegetable or fruits that he can , so that the immune power will increase",

Please note down few triggering factors, responsible for sinusitis (a precursor of allergic asthma) , mite, dust (fine dusting powder), pollen, hay, fodder, sudden fall & rise of temperature, mold, humidity, cold clammy atmosphere. So avoidance is necessary for sinusitis. When someone get allergy (when come in contact with some allergen) there develops bronchoconstriction and this causes blockage of nose (as you mentioned that there was surgery for nasal bone), sinusitis, wheezing sound (whistling sound) and difficult breathing. As far as known to me there is no specific fruits which act against allergic factors. However, immunity increases with the use of protein diet. Now you main question \"is there any allopatry medicine \"which can cure this disease completely ? No, whenever someone come on contact with allergy he will develop allergy, hence sinusitis, hence asthma. Only precautionary steps should be taken. When such type of patient visit in my clinic I advise them to take \"montelukast+ albuterol (combo pack) once or twice in day according to condition of patient and severity of symptoms.

But ortho doctor says its normal.",
    "output": "Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of your daughter. As she has a cyst formed in the medial posterior aspect of the bone I think it should be a calcium deposition. Since the child is in the growing stages she may have some changes of growth of the bones. As bones also has some remodeling phase during the growing ages of a Child certain things are time framed and goes off on its own. As the or tho said, this is not to worry as he might want to speak about the growing phase of your child and also the remodeling of the bone which he must have not explained. In my opinion this is not so worrying thing as its only giving pain due to the remodeling of the bone. In case the pain worsens over a period of time and this remodeling doesn't remove the excess deposition of the cyst may be an excision of the cyst will be performed. In my clinical practice many parents comes with child having pain and aches, but this is the growing phase of the child and may have some aches and pains. I advise them to take the child for swimming as it will help better for muscle movements for its relaxation, strengthening and stretching. I will recommend you the same to try out swimming, and I am sure your daughter will be fine. I wish your daughter a good health and a blessing from God. Regards Jay In Chat Doctor. "

Certain structural spine conditions (for example, degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis) can cause ongoing pain until successfully treated. These conditions are due to a diagnosable anatomical problem. If the pain caused by these types of conditions has not subsided after a few weeks or months of conservative (nonoperative) treatments, then spine surgery may usually be considered as a treatment option.

The decreased hearing in the ear may be due to infection in the ear or dysfunction of the Eustachian tube (tube in the ear). Loss of appetite, coughing, chills can occur with these infections.

    "output": "Hello, Thanks for trusting us with your health concern. I have gone through your query and here are the answers. Firstly, any unprotected intercourse during the safe period does not cause conception. Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period and this is the fertile period in the cycle. So, if you happened to have the intercourse during the safe period, you are naturally protected. The intake of the emergency pill occurred during the stipulated time after the intercourse, so the protection offered is in the range of 98%. The pill can cause side effects like nausea, headaches, vomiting, breast tenderness and with Chat Doctor.  The next natural period also may get delayed by a week or two. Please restrict the use of the pill to one or two occasions per year and get further help if you become overdue by ten days for your next period. Hope this helps."

Headaches, wierd smells, fatigue, nausea, and now sudden nipple and breast pain. I have never had nipple or breast pain before even as pms.(I usually do not expierience pms) My periods have been irregular since they started and i take bithcontrol. My main concerns are the breast/nipple pai. And the abdominal pain. Any ideas?",
    "output": "Hi! Good afternoon. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. The pain on the left side of your abdomen could be due to gastritis caused by the possible intake of any painkillers consumed by you for the headaches, etc. If not, it could be due to any intra-abdominal inflammation for which a physical examination along with blood test like a CBC, LFT, serum amylase and serum lipase would have to be done, specially if you consume alcoholic beverages. Till then, you could go for some anti-spasmodic and a proton pump inhibitor Chat Doctor.  A word of caution on birth control pills: All the precautions including birth control pills are not 100% foolproof in protection against a pregnancy. If I were your doctor, I would also go for a serum Chat Doctor determination and an ultrasound abdomen to rule this out, and then consider your symptoms of breast pain, nausea and fatigue etc. not to be due to a pregnancy, if these tests were negative. If positive, the whole management plan would change accordingly. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery. Chat Doctor."

Could i be pregnant? or is the contraceptive still in my system? How long will it stay in my system before i can fall preggies again? Best regards Lee",
    "output": "Hi Lee, How are you doing ? Petogen is a depot preparation, which is taken for duration as 1 yr may stay for 4-6 myths after stopping. But a better way to know if the hormone levels are normal is, if you get periods the hormones are normal. But this is not definitive, you can get pregnant even before you have periods. But after 3-4 myths of last injection the chances of pregnancy gradually increases & by 6 myths the hormone is mostly gone.

    "output": "Hi, as you mentioned with your difficulty in breathing with is increasing as days are passing. So let us understand first the mechanism of breathing. Respiratory system is the only source of providing oxygen to the body as, oxygen is the fuel need for the human life to survive. Also, due to smoking the respiratory system has become weak and there is no such medicine to make it strong or recover again. What can heal with medicine is the symptomatic help for removal of secretions or infection. Since you been smoking also, an added disadvantage has occurred to the respiratory system by weakening the alveoli. Alveoli is the place where the exchange of gases between the respiratory system and blood takes place. In short, it's the place to purify the blood. Also, as you are 64, your muscles of the respiratory system has also got weaker. What need to provide the best help to the respiratory system is to improve the capacity of the lungs which will help you avoid breathless and also improve the quality of blood in the body. I will advise you to do regular breathing exercises which will help improve the strength in the respiratory muscles and the lung tissues. Also doing meditation will help control the brain activity as brain regulates the involuntary control of the respiration. For making the ease of the respiratory system it is advised to perform regular breathing exercise to keep the functionality of the lung to the optimumregardsJay In Chat Doctor. "

    "output": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  Growing cyst can be benign, or it can be malignant.

    "output": "Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  Gall bladder pain may be due to gall atones or chronic or acute cholecystitis or rarely other gall bladder disease. However, all conditions can be easily diagnosed by ultrasound study and MRI. So if you're all ultrasound and MRI reports are normal then there is high chance that you may have some other pathology like muscular pain or other pathology not detected by imaging study. You should go for examination. Search the cause of your pain and take treatment accordingly.  It's less likely that you have any gall bladder disease.

I have a Dr appointment July 7th but until then I will just continue to give him Advil for children and alternate cold and heat. the thing that is bothering me the most is that he arches his neck backwards. He tells me it helps the pain but he can not tell me if he is doing it or if it is an involuntary movement. Any suggestions would be welcomed until I can get him to the Dr.",
    "output": "Hello Chris;welcome to Chat Doctor If your son had a fall landing on his neck he may get pain due to a possible internal injury and to get relief it may be that he is stretching his neck because keeping it in a particular position may be helping him so to avoid the pain he is doing it. Normally it happens that when any person tries to take a particular position to avoid pain or excess pain he may land up doing it involuntarily as a reflex to the pain. Please do not worry and keep giving him painkiller when required and by the time 7th July appointment comes you can get an X-ray of the cervical spine (neck) done, and you will get the report and also come to know whether there is any injury or fracture which is bothering him. With the X-ray you may consult the doctor. Thanks"

Could it have gotten worse maybe need another MRI?",
    "output": "Hi, The symptoms which are getting severe are indicative of progression of cervical spondylosis. You will need a repeat-MRI scan and have it compared with the previous scan to measure the canal diameter and look for disc protrusion or nerve compression. A nerve might have got pinched as it emerges out from the spine which is causing the severe pain. It needs to be looked at and basing on the severity of symptoms you may need to undergo surgery."
